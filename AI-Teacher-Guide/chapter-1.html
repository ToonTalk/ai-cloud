<h2>A teacher's guide to helping students build AI apps and artefacts</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1 - Speech Output</h3>
<h4>Ken Kahn, University of Oxford</h4>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The importance of artificial Intelligence in society, the workplace, and the economy is rapidly increasing.
It is becoming an important part of many other technologies. AI conversational agents are becoming common in phones and PCs (Siri, Cortana, OK Google).
Driverless vehicles are coming soon.
Finance, medicine, and many other fields are relying more and more on AI.
Even toys are beginning to embed AI.</p>

<p>Is there something to learn about intelligence in general by studying AI?
AI researchers attempts to give computers the abilities to perceive, to solve problems, to plan, and to reason
shed light on intelligence beyond what studying human and animal psychology can.</p>

<p>AI raises many questions:</p>
<ul><li>What is the future of work?</li>
<li>How dangerous is AI?</li>
<li>How to ensure AIs make ethical choices?</li>
<li>Would you want a robot to be your child's best friend?</li></ul>
<h3>Ways of teaching AI</h3>
<p>Broadly there are three approaches</p>
<ol><li>Readings, lectures, and discussions about AI's history, ideas, and technologies</li>
<li>Readings, lectures, and discussions about social issues impacted by AI</li>
<li>Supporting hands-on experiences creating AI apps and artefacts</li></ol>

<p>While this guide touches on 1 and 2 and its focus is on 3.While some aspects of building AI applications are best suited for those with phds in the field,
there are many projects that even young school students can do.
If the power of speech and image recognition or the possibilities of machine learning are given easy programming interfaces
then even beginners can use them in their creations.</p>
<h3>Speech output</h3>
<p>Let's start by exploring speech synthesis.
Is the ability to transform text into spoken speech really an example of AI?
Humans need to spend a long time learning to read (out loud).
But reading involves character recognition and spelling as well as comprehension.
When a computer produces speech none of that is involved.
Is this an aspect of intelligent behaviour or it is just like a parrot speaking?
Perhaps a good topic for students to discuss.
And note that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_(parrot)" target="_blank">Alex the parrot</a> clearly did more than "parroting" speech.</p>

<p>Before discussing what is technically involved in synthesising speech let's look at how it can be used by students.
Let's start with the simplest program block for speaking. Click on it to try it out.
(Currently only works well in Chrome.)</p>

</iframe></div>

<h4>How does this work?</h4>
>p>The Web is full of explanations of how speech synthesis works. 
Microsoft has this <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/hh361668%28v=office.14%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank">short explanation</a>.
<i>Explain that Stuff</i> has a <href="http://www.explainthatstuff.com/how-speech-synthesis-works.html" target="_blank">much longer explanation including a history of speech synthesis</a>.
And there is always the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis" target="_blank">Wikipedia's entry</a>.
</p>

<h4>Sentences are more than a series of words</h4>
</p>Speech synthesizers do more than just say each word in a sentence.
They attempt to produce a natural prosidy.
And they speak questions differently from sentences.
</p>

<div  class="iframe-container" style="width: 580px; height: 140px"> 
<iframe class="iframe-clipped"
        scrolling="no"
        src="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=aiteacherguide&ProjectName=separate%20words&noRun&noExitWarning&editMode&hideControls"> 
</iframe></div>

<p>And for a human speaking numbers and punctuation signs can be a bit challenging.
Is this a sign of intelligence?</p>

<div class="iframe-container"> 
<iframe class="iframe-clipped"
        scrolling="no"
        src="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=aiteacherguide&ProjectName=numbers%20signs&noRun&noExitWarning&editMode&hideControls"> 
</iframe></div>

<h4>Problems combining speech and sound effects</h4>
<p>Suppose one wanted the computer to speech, be interupted by a door bell, and respond accordingly.
Try clicking this and you'll hear there is a problem:</p>

<div  class="iframe-container" style="width: 480px; height: 140px"> 
<iframe class="iframe-clipped"
        scrolling="no"
        src="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=aiteacherguide&ProjectName=doorbell%20problem&noRun&noExitWarning&editMode&hideControls"> 
</iframe></div>

<p>The problem is because the way the speak block works is that it tells the browswer to begin speaking and then continues with the next action.
What we want is to have the door bell sound played <i>after</i> the first utterance is finished.
For this we need a slightly more complex block that accepts actions to do after speaking:</p>

<div class="iframe-container" style="width: 600px; height: 140px;">
<iframe class="iframe-clipped"
        scrolling="no"
        src="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=aiteacherguide&ProjectName=doorbell%20fix&noRun&noExitWarning&editMode&hideControls"> 
</iframe></div>

<h4>What is speech synthesis good for?</h4>
<p>Speech synthesis is a good way for software to communicate with people that are blind or visually impaired.
And for devices such as a talking clock or a robot without a display there are few alternatives.
Or when the user's eyes need to attend to something exclusively (e.g. a surgeon during an operation or a pilot flying a plane).
Speech output is often the best way to communicate with children or adults who have yet to learn to read.
And speech synthesis gives those who physically cannot speak (e.g. Stephen Hawking) a way to communicate.
Many argue that a conversation is often a more natural, friendly, and more pleasant interface to devices
than displays, keyboards, mice, buttons, and touch sensors.</p>

<h4>Controlling speech output</h4>
<p>A person can speak slow or fast, in a low or high pitch, quietly or loudly, and more.
And different people have different voices and accents.
To mirror these abilities a more complex block is available.
A paramter value of 1 means the normal pitch, rate, or volume.
Note that depending upon the voice and browser some of these parameters are ignored.</p>

<div class="iframe-container" style="width: 800px; height: 100px;">
<iframe class="iframe-clipped"
        scrolling="no"
        src="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=aiteacherguide&ProjectName=rate%20pitch%20volume&noRun&noExitWarning&editMode&hideControls"> 
</iframe></div>

<p>Regarding the 'language' option, unfortunately many browsers currently ignore it.
The argument should be one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag" target="_blank">IETF language tags</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately in some browsers (e.g. Chrome) some voices are associated with a language.
When a non-English voice is given English to speak it typically speaks it with an accent.
The selection of voices available depends upon the browser and the operating system.
Click 'get voices' to see the list of voices and use the voice number in the speak command.</p>

<div class="iframe-container" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;">
<iframe class="iframe-clipped"
        scrolling="no"
        src="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=aiteacherguide&ProjectName=voices&noRun&noExitWarning&editMode&hideControls"> 
</iframe></div>

<p>A voice is more than just a voice.
Listen to the two ways of reading dates.</p>

<div class="iframe-container" style="width: 800px; height: 200px;">
<iframe class="iframe-clipped"
        scrolling="no"
        src="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=aiteacherguide&ProjectName=dates&noRun&noExitWarning&editMode&hideControls"> 
</iframe></div>

<h4>If your browser has too few available voices or you want to try a different speech engine</h4>
<p>Some browsers and some operating systems have very few (or <i>no</i>) voices.
An alternative speech block uses a server in Germany that has its own set of voices.</p>

<div class="iframe-container" style="width: 800px; height: 500px;">

<h3>Where to get these blocks to use in projects</h3>
<p>All of these speech output blocks as well other AI blocks are available to use in <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Snap!</a> in
this <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=toontalk&ProjectName=eCraft2Learn" target="_blank">Snap project</a>.
They can also be used togehter with blocks for controlling Arduinos by downloading and then importing
