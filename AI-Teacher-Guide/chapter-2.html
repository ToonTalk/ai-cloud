<h2>A teacher's guide to helping students build AI apps and artefacts</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2 - Speech Input</h3>
<h4>Ken Kahn, University of Oxford</h4>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>It is much easier to get a computer to start with text and end up with speech
than to start with speech and end up with the corresponding text.
Speech causes vibrations in the air that cause vibrations in the computer's microphone.
These vibrations are converted to numbers.
Speech recognition begins with these numbers and attempts to determine what was said.
As you'll see the process is not perfect, mistakes occur.</p>
<h4>A simple speech recognition block</h4>
<p>Click on the following block, say something, then click on the 'last thing heard' variable.
If all is working well you should see what you just said.</p>

<div class="iframe-container" style="width: 800px; height: 140px;">
<iframe class="iframe-clipped"
        scrolling="no"
        src="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=aiteacherguide&ProjectName=simple%20listen%20block&noRun&noExitWarning&editMode&hideControls"> 
</iframe></div>

<h4>Speech recognition errors</h4>
<p>Speech recognition can encounter errors such as the inability to access the microphone.
The most common "error" is when after several seconds nothing is heard.
The 'listen' block keeps listening until there is an error.
(Try saying something, look at the result, say something else, and look again.)
When the nothing said error occurs the error block is given the text "no-speech".
(Note that if you say "no speech" then there is no hyphen.)
Other errors are 'audio-capture' when the browser can't find a microphone and 
'not-allowed' when permission to use the microphone hasn't been granted.
Try the following and then be quiet for a while.</p>

<div class="iframe-container" style="width: 800px; height: 200px;">
<iframe class="iframe-clipped"
        scrolling="no"

</iframe></div>

<h4>A sample program using speech recognition (and synthesis)</h4>
<p>The following program uses the 'listen' block to control a sprite.
You can tell it to go forward or to the turn right.
It will then ask you how much and then execute the command.
A similar program could be written to control a physical device such as a robot or a set of lights.</p>

<h4>How the speech command programs works</h4>
<p>If you right click on 'speak turtle commands' and select 'edit' you'll see the program.
The 'spoken' variable contains what was just recognised.
The nested 'if-then-else' commands test for exiting commands, then forward commands, and then turning commands.
If none match then a 'not understood' response is created.
Both the turning and moving commands cause the program to ask for amount.
When a number is spoken the turtle then turns or moves appropriately.</p>

<h4>An alternative way to do the same thing</h4>
<p>The command program relies upon what computer scientists call 'continuations'.
These are blocks of code that are executed when something happens, in this case when the speech is recognised.
An alternative that is popular among Scratch programmers is to rely instead upon broadcasting messages.
The following implements voice commands by using a helper command called 'listen'.
'listen' broadcasts the message 'heard something'.
The program fragments that listen for 'heard something' broadcasts need to know what was heard.
The variable 'last thing heard' is used for this.
This style of programming is perhaps easier for young children but it does have its limitations.
For example, it is very difficult to implement a response when no other parts of the program understand what was said.
The first version responds by saying it didn't understand what was said, repeats what it thinks it heard, and says to try again.
The following version cannot do so.</p>

<h4>A full-featured 'listen' block</h4>
<p>The speech recognition engines typically can do more than the above blocks.
One can specify which language is expected.
The engine can report interim results and alternative results.
It can provide 'confidence' values indicating how certain it is that it recognised the speech correctly.
All of these functionalities are provided by this block:</p>

<div class="iframe-container" style="width: 800px; height: 200px;">
<iframe class="iframe-clipped"
        scrolling="no"
        src="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=aiteacherguide&ProjectName=complex%20listen%20block&noRun&noExitWarning&editMode&hideControls"> 
</iframe></div>

<p>The arguments to this block are:
<ol>
<li>The first argument are blocks that receive interim results as they are produced. Can be left blank.</li>
<li>The next argument are blocks that receive the final result.</li>
<li>The next argument receives errors if there are any. Can be left blank.</li>
<li>Text in the format language-dialect. E.g. en-GB. It should be one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag" target="_blank">IETF language tags</a>. Can be left blank.</li>
<li>The maximum number of alternative recognition results. If not provided it is 1. Note the recognition engine may return fewer results.</li>
<li>Blocks that receive a list of alternative results. Can be left blank.</li>
<li>Blocks that receive a list of confidence numbers corresponding to the alternative results. 0 means no confidence while 1 is the highest. Can be left blank.</li>
</ol>
Note that for Google's speech recognition engine currently only the first alternative has a non-zero confidence.</p>

<p>Watching the interim results can provide some insight into the process of recognition.
You can test this using the above block where you put the say block with an empty text field in the first argument.
(Snap! interprets an empty field in this context as the input to the blocks (in this case the current interim result).)
Or by using <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html" target="_blank">this Google demo</a>.
For example, if you say "red" you'll see "red" but if you follow it with "a book" you'll see "red" become "read a book".</p>

<p>There is much one can explore with the 'language' option.
For example, if one selects 'fr-FR' (French as spoken in France) and then says "une deux trois quatre five six" the result is "1 2 3 4 5 6".
Notice that it recognises both Frendh and English.
(English is probably used because it the operating system language setting on my computer --
if your computer is configured with another language it probably will be the default.)
Strangely if with English you say "one two three four five six" you get those words, not the digits one sees with the French setting.</p>

<h3>Where to get these blocks to use in projects</h3>
<p>All of these speech output blocks as well other AI blocks are available to use in <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Snap!</a> in
this <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=toontalk&ProjectName=eCraft2Learn" target="_blank">Snap project</a>.
They can also be used together with blocks for controlling Arduinos by downloading and then importing
