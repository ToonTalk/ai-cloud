<h3>Chapter 2 - Speech Input</h3>
<h4>Ken Kahn, University of Oxford</h4>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>It is much easier to get a computer to start with text and end up with speech
than to start with speech and end up with the corresponding text.
Speech causes vibrations in the air that cause vibrations in the computer's microphone.
These vibrations are converted to numbers.
Speech recognition begins with these numbers and attempts to determine what was said.
As you'll see the process is not perfect, mistakes occur.</p>
<h4>A simple speech recognition block</h4>
<p>Click on the following block, say something, then click on the 'last thing heard' variable.
If all is working well you should see what you just said.</p>

<div class="iframe-container" style="width: 800px; height: 140px;">
<iframe class="iframe-clipped"
        scrolling="no"
        src="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=aiteacherguide&ProjectName=simple%20listen%20block&noRun&noExitWarning&editMode&hideControls"> 
</iframe></div>

<h4>Speech recognition errors</h4>
<p>Speech recognition can encounter errors such as the inability to access the microphone.
The most common "error" is when after several seconds nothing is heard.
The 'listen' block keeps listening until there is an error.
(Try saying something, look at the result, say something else, and look again.)
When the nothing said error occurs the error block is given the text "no-speech".
(Note that if you say "no speech" then there is no hypen.)
Try the following and then be quiet for a while.</p>

<div class="iframe-container" style="width: 800px; height: 200px;">
<iframe class="iframe-clipped"
        scrolling="no"
        src="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=aiteacherguide&ProjectName=listen%20error&noRun&noExitWarning&editMode&hideControls">

<h3>Where to get these blocks to use in projects</h3>
<p>All of these speech output blocks as well other AI blocks are available to use in <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Snap!</a> in
this <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=toontalk&ProjectName=eCraft2Learn" target="_blank">Snap project</a>.
They can also be used togehter with blocks for controlling Arduinos by downloading and then importing
<a href="https://toontalk.github.io/ai-cloud/AI-Teacher-Guide\AI%20Teacher%20Guide%20projects/eCraft2Learn%20S4A.xml" download>this file</a>
into <a href="http://snap4arduino.rocks/" target="_blank">Snap4Arduino</a>.
