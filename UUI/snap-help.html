<a ref="https://snap.berkeley.edu">Snap!</a> is a big brother of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>.
It can do much more than Scratch but is a bit more complex.
It is <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/help/SnapManual.pdf">documented here.</a>
</p>
</p>
Most importantly it has enabled the <a href="http://project.ecraft2learn.eu/">eCraft2Learn project</a> to add new blocks. These include
<ol>
<li>
the ability to use speech input and output
</li>
<li>
image recognition by connecting to AI cloud services (<a href="https://github.com/ToonTalk/ai-cloud/wiki">free API keys required</a>)
</li>
<li>
the ability to read and write the digital pins of a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> or <a href="http://www.arduino.org/">Arduino connected to a Raspberry Pi</a>.
Note that this requires the running of a local server on the Raspberry Pi.
This has already been performed if you are using an eCraft2Learn SD card on a Raspberry Pi.
</li>
</ol>
These blocks are <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=toontalk&ProjectName=eCraft2Learn">available here</a> and
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AoyxwHfYyrlxP4nlDYOR1ZXlOycB7NSXgiZNZtaNzmc/edit?usp=sharing">documented here</a>.
</p>
<p>
For controlling Arduinos beyond simple digital sensors and actuators we recommend <a href="snap4arduino-help.html">Snap4Arduino</a> which adds many new blocks for programming Arduinos.
